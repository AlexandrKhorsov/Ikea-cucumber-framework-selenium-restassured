    Assignment # 3: Refactor Java code
            Junior automation engineer was asked to implement a utility method that:
                1. accepts a string that includes from 0 to N words of a name
                2. returns a string that represents the first letter from each word in the name followed by "."
                For example: "Bruno Mars" → "B.M."
                "Dave M Jones" → "D.M.J."
                "MichaelSmith" → "M."
                Please, review his implementation, see if there is a room for improvement and refactor it.
